            <p>Now, what you hear is not a test I'm rappin' to the beat,
              And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
              See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
              To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,

              The purple and yellow. But first, I gotta
              Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,
              Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
              Let's rock, you don't stop,
            </p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <p>
              Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
              Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,
              And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
              C'mon, Hank, sing that song!
            <p>  
              Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
              And the rest is F-L-Y,
              You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
              And these reasons I'll tell you why.
              You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
              When I dress to a T,
              You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
              And I dress so viciously.
              I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
              That definitely ain't the wack,
              I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac.
              So after school I take a dip in the pool,
              Which is really on the wall,
              I got a colour TV, so I can see
              The Knicks play basketball. Hear me talk about
              Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
              Than a sucker could ever spend,
              But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker
              Not a dime 'til I made it again. Everybody go
              Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
              'Cause I'm a get a fly girl,
              Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go
              Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
              Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend.
