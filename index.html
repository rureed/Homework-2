            <p>Now, what you hear is not a test I'm rappin' to the beat,
              And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
              See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
              To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,
              The purple and yellow. But first, I gotta
              Bang bang, the boogie to the boogie,
              Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
              Let's rock, you don't stop,
              Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
              Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,
              And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
              C'mon, Hank, sing that song!
              Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
              And the rest is F-L-Y,
              You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
              And these reasons I'll tell you why.
              You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
              When I dress to a T,
              You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
              And I dress so viciously.
              I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
              That definitely ain't the wack,
              I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac.
              So after school I take a dip in the pool,
              Which is really on the wall,
              I got a colour TV, so I can see
              The Knicks play basketball. Hear me talk about
              Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
              Than a sucker could ever spend,
              But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker
              Not a dime 'til I made it again. Everybody go
              Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
              'Cause I'm a get a fly girl,
              Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go
              Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
              Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend.
              Master Gee! My mellow!
              It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?
              Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
              The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
              I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
              I said I go by the unforgettable name
              Of the man they call the Master Gee.
              Well, my name is known all over the world
              By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls.
              I'm goin' down in history
              As the baddest rapper there ever could be.
              Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
              The beat starts gettin' into your toes
              You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
              And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
              And then damn! Ya start doin' the freak, I said
              Damn! Right outta your seat
              Then you throw your hands high in the air,
              Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
              Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
              With the sureshot MCs for the affair.
              Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
              But I rap to the beat just the same.
              I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
              All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
              Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
              The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
              Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
              Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
              Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
              Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
              I guess by now you can take a hunch
              And find that I am the baby of the bunch
              But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
              'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
              Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
              The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
              Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
              Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
              I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
              I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere.
              'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
              I put the dick, dick, dick in your behind. I said
              One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
              A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
              'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
              I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
              What are you waiting for?
              I said a hip hop,
              The hippie to the hippie
              The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
              To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
              To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
              A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
              And guess what, America, we love you
              'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
              You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old.
              I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
              But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
              Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
              Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
              To the beat, beat, it's so unique
              Come on everybody and dance to the beat!
              Ever went over a friends house to eat
              And the food just ain't no good?
              I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
              And the chicken tastes like wood
              So you try to play it off like you think you can
              By saying that you're full
              And then your friend says, "Mama, he's just being polite
              He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!"
              So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
              And you say that you already ate
              And your friend says "Man, there's plenty of food"
              So you pile some more on your plate
              While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
              Of the moment that it's time to leave
              And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
              Into something that looks like cheese
              Oh so you say "That's it, I gotta leave this place
              I don't care what these people think,
              I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
              With this ugly food that stinks"
              So you bust out the door while it's still closed
              Still sick from the food you ate
              And then you run to the store for quick relief
              From a bottle of Kaopectate
              And then you call your friend two weeks later
              To see how he has been
              And he says, "I understand about the food,
              Baby Bubba, but we're still friends"
              With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
              The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
              To the bang bang boogie
              Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat</p>
